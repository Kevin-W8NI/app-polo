    message: |
      Every new source file must begin with the following header:

      ```javascript
      /*
       * Copyright ©️ 2025 Sebastian Delmont <sd@ham2k.com>
       *
       * This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
       * If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can obtain one at https://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
       */
      ```

      The header should be followed by a blank line before any imports or code begin.

      The copyright line should reflect the current year, and the name and email of the author.

      It's ok if some files include multiple authors. Or if the author
      of a specific file is not Sebastian Delmont.
